# Customer-Segmentation-Clusters-Project
This analysis applies Exploratory Data Analysis and K-Means clustering supported by visualizations such as histograms, pair plots, heatmaps, box plots, and count plots, as well as metrics like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to identify optimal customer segments and reveal clear behavioural patterns for targeted strategies.

# Insights & Findings
•	Elbow Method: There appears to be a clear “elbow point,” indicating the ideal number of clusters.<br>
•	Silhouette Score: Peaks around this selected number of clusters, validating segmentation quality.<br>
•	Cluster Visualization: The customer groups are distinct and well-separated, demonstrating successful segmentation.

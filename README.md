# Customer-Segmentation-Clusters-Python-Project
This analysis applies Exploratory Data Analysis and K-Means clustering supported by visualizations such as histograms, pair plots, heatmaps, box plots, and count plots, as well as metrics like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to identify optimal customer segments and reveal clear behavioural patterns for targeted strategies.

# Insights & Findings
•	Elbow Method: The Elbow Method is a technique used in clustering to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the WCSS against different k values and choosing the point where the decrease slows down, forming an “Elbow” shape.</br>
•	Silhouette Score: The Silhouette Score is a measure of how well data points are clustered by evaluating both the cohesion within clusters and the separation between clusters, with values closer to one indicating better clustering.</br>
•	Cluster Visualization: A scatter plot of final clusters visually displays the grouped data points in a 2D space, where each cluster is shown with distinct markers or colours to help observe the separation, structure, and distribution of the clusters after the clustering process.

# Why This Project Stands Out
This project stands out because it leverages advanced exploratory analysis and clustering techniques to uncover meaningful customer groups, providing clear, actionable insights that help businesses personalize strategies, optimize marketing efforts, and make smarter data-driven decisions.
